Yay for MDIA 1620!

Here are **three Aha! moments** 😸

1. Finding out I can put emojis on here🔥💯

2. Flipping through my files on the Terminal. Looks a lot more confusing than it is!

3. Learning about past interfaces and how they worked.

Now here are **two things I'm unclear about...**

1. How Github is incorporated while coding

2. Coding in general 😿

**One word for how I'm feeling: ~~sleepy~~ *Excited!*** 🎆🍾🥳
