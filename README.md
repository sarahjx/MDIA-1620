# MDIA-1620
Yay for MDIA 1620!
---------
Here are **three Aha! moments** 😸

1. Finding out I can put emojis on here🔥💯

2. Flipping through my files on the Terminal. Looks a lot more confusing than it is!

3. Learning about past interfaces and how they worked.

--------
Now here are **two things I'm unclear about...**

1. How Github is incorporated while coding

2. Coding in general 😿

--------

**One word for how I'm feeling: ~~sleepy~~ *Excited!*** 🎆🍾🥳

Notes from class
> Coding is possible in terminal but it's very hard and a steep learning curve (not worth it)

> Benefits of using Github: A graphical user interface to view and manage user control changes easily (visually appealing). 

> Currently: we are currently coding with Markdown (a coding language) using Git. Not with "coding with Github." 

> Course outline: 40% lab work 30% midterm exam 30% final exam

> 1 point for attendance, 1 point for watching the video /12
